It has been a month since my last journal entry which was just before I went on a short trip with my wife. Since then, I've been preparing for job interviews in my spare time by practicing coding challenges on HackerRank. I passed the Amazon coding assessment and I'm still waiting for the next phase of the interview process. Grinding coding challenges gave me a bit of burnout so I took a week off any personal programming work to enjoy playing the game Satisfactory in my free time which had just recently released.

My personal project, Minotaur, was calling me back so I jumped into where I left off with the UI layout update. I added logic to resize the root UI component when the screen size changes and set all fonts and spacing values to use container units relative to the root component. One side effect I found with this type of relative styling is that font size does not change when the browser window is zoomed in or out which means the layout won't break from unexpected content overflow. I also replaced much of the UI element positioning with grid layouts. The final result is a much cleaner UI which is ready to add the events log component.

I'll familiarize myself with what I was working on in the backend for the events log then get to building out the frontend component next.
