## Introducing Proton
My friend [Kurt](https://www.instagram.com/ofsilentlife/) mentioned that for his email he uses Proton which is located in Switzerland and has excellent security and privacy laws. I've wanted to use my domain name for a professional email for some time, but I didn't want to pay for email server hosting. Now that I've got a fresh coat of paint on my website, I feel I can drop a couple bucks to create a better email address to compliment it. Kurt sends me a referral link so I can sign up for a 1 month trial.

I sign up for the Mail Plus trial which is only \\$5 per month (or \\$48 annually) and offers 10 email addresses plus 1 custom domain name. I follow the docs for [setting up a custom domain]( https://proton.me/support/custom-domain) which is the standard process of creating DNS records to verify domain ownership and all the anti-spoofing features needed to not have my sent messages end up in Gmail spam folders. It only takes about 30 minutes for the DNS records to update and I can create my new address [corey@corkbits.com](mailto:corey@corkbits.com).

Here is [my referral link](https://pr.tn/ref/3V4B7CDZE2KG) for anyone wanting to try out a Proton trial.
